# Generative LLMs for feature extraction from customer service chats  

I developed this project for my master thesis as an intern for a consultancy firm. 
The goal was to integrate Generative Large Language Models from the GPT family into an advanced analytics architecture for customer service chat analysis in a corporate setting.   

**GenAI_FeatureExtraction.pdf** provides an overview of the whole process, while part of the code (written in PySpark) is in **Code**.
In the repository, you can find also my master thesis which contains a detailed description of each stage and a detailed description of some parts of the code in the Appendix.
