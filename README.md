# Generative LLMs for feature extraction from customer service chats  

Project I developed for my master thesis as an intern for a consultancy firm. 
The goal was to integrate Generative Large Language Models from the GPT family into an advanced analytics architecture for customer service chat analysis in a corporate setting. 
A key contribution of this work is the development of an Italian-language prompt for feature extraction, leveraging state-of-the-art prompt engineering techniques.  

**GenAI_FeatureExtraction.pdf** provide an overview of the whole process, while the code (written in PySpark) is in **Folder**.
